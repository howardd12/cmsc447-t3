this is what ive been messing around with, its just a skeleton of what the app will look like,
hopefully this will help other people to see a way to use flask. i havent gotten to returning variables yet

it renders both welcome, and main pages,

i would suggest we start making the welcome page becuase that one is easy while we try to work on the database

if someone wants to make an offical project using this code or referring to this code to make the main project thats total fine!

if you have any questions feel free to hit me up on slack!
